If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018,
I would characterize their audio aura by analyzing attributes
like tempo, danceability, energy, valence, and mode from the database.
For example, if many songs have high energy and danceability, their aura might be described as "energetic and upbeat."
Conversely, if the songs lean toward low tempo and minor key, their aura might be "calm and introspective."

However, this method of calculating an audio aura might not be very representative of the listener for several reasons:

1- Time Constraint:
    The dataset only includes songs from 2018, which may not reflect the listener's current or overall musical preferences.
2- Selection Bias:
    The database includes only the top 100 songs, potentially emphasizing frequently repeated tracks while ignoring diversity in listening habits.
3- Lack of Context:
    We don't know why the listener chose these songs. They might have been part of a specific mood, season, or life event.
4- Quantitative Limits:
    Relying solely on numeric audio features (like tempo or energy) doesn't capture lyrical themes, genres, or emotional meaning.

A better way to calculate a more representative audio aura might include:

1- Analyzing a full year or multi-year history of listening habits, not just the top tracks.
2- Considering playlist diversity, not just frequency.
3- Including genre and lyrical sentiment analysis alongside audio features.
4- Factoring in temporal patterns, like how listening habits vary by time of day or season.

This would paint a more holistic and dynamic picture of the listener's true musical personality.
